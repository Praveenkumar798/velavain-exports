## 💰 **ESTIMATED REVENUE IMPACT**

### **Based on B2B Export Industry Standards:**

**Current Situation:**
- No pricing = Many inquiries from non-serious buyers
- Time wasted on price requests
- Lost opportunities due to lack of transparency

**With New Pricing:**
- **30-40% reduction** in non-qualified inquiries
- **50-60% increase** in serious quote requests
- **Faster sales cycle** (2-3 weeks vs 4-6 weeks)
- **Higher conversion rate** (15-20% vs 5-10%)

**Example Calculation:**
- 100 monthly visitors
- 20% inquiry rate = 20 inquiries
- With pricing: 60% qualified = 12 serious buyers
- 20% conversion = 2-3 orders per month
- Average order: $10,000-50,000
- **Potential monthly revenue: $20,000-150,000**
